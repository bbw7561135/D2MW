YMW16 is a model for the distribution of free electrons in the Galaxy
(Gal), the Magellanic Clouds (MC) and the inter-galactic medium (IGM)
that can be used to estimate distances for real or simulated pulsars
and fast radio bursts (FRBs) based on their dispersion measure.

The Galactic model is based on 189 pulsars that have independently
determined distances as well as dispersion measures, whereas simpler
models are used for the electron density in the MC and the IGM. It is
estimated that the 95% of predicted Galactic pulsar distances will
have a relative error of less than a factor of 0.9. Pulse broadening
due to scattering in the Galactic interstellar medium, the Magellanic
Clouds, the intergalactic medium and FRB host galaxies is estimated.

A paper (Yao, Manchester and Wang, 2016) describing the model and
comparing its predictions with those of earlier Galactic electron
density models has been accepted by the Astrophysical Journal and is on 
arXiv  (1610.09448). YMW16 is the first electron-density model to 
estimate extragalactic pulsar distances and FRB distances.

To make a command-line executable version of the program, download and
unpack the latest version of the program. Then run "make_ymw16" to
create the executable. The environment variable YMW16_DIR may be set
up to point at a directory containing ymw16par.txt and
spiral.txt. Access to these files is needed at runtime. 

Websites allowing interactive access to the YMW16 distance model and
download of the latest program version are available at http://www.xao.ac.cn/ymw16/
and http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/ymw16/.
